      <h1>The Houses</h1>
      <p class="about">In Hogwarts, there are four houses into which all students are sorted. This sorting is done by the "sorting hat", which is able to determine
        the character traits of every student, in order to make sure everyone gets sorted into the one house, which best represents their personality. <br><br>
        The four houses are: </p>

      <h2>Gryffindor</h2>
      <p class="about">Gryffindor is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by Godric Gryffindor.
        Godric instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued,
        such as courage, chivalry, and determination, to be sorted into his house. <br><br>
        The emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold. <br><br>
        Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick" is the House ghost.</p>

      <h2>Hufflepuff</h2>
      <p class="about">Hufflepuff is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
        Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff.
        Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play
        rather than a particular aptitude in its members. <br><br>
        The emblematic animal is a badger, and yellow and black are its colours. <br><br>
        The Head of Hufflepuff is Pomona Sprout and the Fat Friar is the House's patron ghost. </p>
